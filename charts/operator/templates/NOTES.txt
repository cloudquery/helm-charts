# Add the following snippet to your Helm configuration YAML during platform installation or upgrade
# to ensure the platform can communicate with the operator:
scheduler:
  address: {{ include "operator.fullname" . }}.{{ .Release.Namespace }}:3001

Alternatively, you can append the --set flag to your Helm command:

  helm install <params> --set "scheduler.address={{ include "operator.fullname" . }}.{{ .Release.Namespace }}:3001"
